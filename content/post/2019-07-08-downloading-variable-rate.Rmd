```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(SwapPricer)
```

In this post we will close the trilogy on (old style) swap pricing. In particular, we will look at how downloading the data for the variable rate needed to calculate the variable leg accrual.

* [Part 1](https://www.curiousfrm.com/2019/03/using-the-tidyverse-for-swap-pricing/)
gave the general idea behind tidy pricing interest rate swaps using a 7 lines 
pipe 

* [Part 2](https://www.curiousfrm.com/2019/04/real-world-tidy-interest-rate-swap-pricing/)
went much more into detail and priced some real world contract comparing the results
obtained vs Bloomberg and showing significantly good results.

The only part missing was calculating the accrual for the floating leg. To do this
we need the information about the historical level of the interest rate to which the leg 
is linked. 

For standard EUR contracts, this rate is the 6 months' EURIBOR. For those of you
who are interested in understanding more what this rate is can go [this link](https://www.euribor-rates.eu/what-is-euribor.asp)

Sourcing the data is not a problem, but doing it the `R` way (ie. for free), can be.

Luckily the awesome [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) data provider actually 
provides the information we need. *Quandl* is a premier source for financial, economic, and alternative datasets, serving investment professionals. Quandl’s platform is used by over 400,000 people, including analysts from the world’s top hedge funds, asset managers and investment banks.

Pulling data from Quandl is very easy using the `Quandl` package available on *CRAN*
Its logic is quite simple:
```{r Quandl, eval=FALSE}
Quandl::Quandl(code, start_date, end_date)
```
where *code* is a unique identifier that can be sourced from the Quandl website.

In particular, we shoudl be grateful to the *Bank of France* which provides all 
the interest rate information we need. Going on their 
[page](https://www.quandl.com/data/BOF-Bank-of-France) we can in fact find that 
the code for the 6 months EURIBOR rate is "BOF/QS_D_IEUTIO6M".

Let's then see what the output of this very simple function is with our code:

```{r}
rates <- Quandl::Quandl("BOF/QS_D_IEUTIO6M", 
               start_date = lubridate::dmy("01-01-2018"), 
               end_date = lubridate::dmy("31-12-2018"))

rates %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Output from Quandl", "html") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>% 
   kableExtra::scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

We now have to incorporate this code into the overall coding strategy described 
in the [previous post](https://www.curiousfrm.com/2019/04/real-world-tidy-interest-rate-swap-pricing/)

Before we dive in how I coded this, let's see how I changed the data structure of
how a swap is defined:

```{r}
swap.25y <- list(notional = 10000000,
                  start.date = lubridate::ymd(20070119),
                  maturity.date = lubridate::ymd(20320119), 
                  strike = 0.00059820,
                  type = "receiver", 
                  time.unit = list(pay = 6, receive = 12), 
                  dcc = list(pay = 0, receive = 6), 
                  calendar = "TARGET")
```

This new data structure now allows to define - as it should be - different 
characteristics (like coupon frequency or day count convention) for the different
legs (`payer` and `receiver`) of the swap. In particular, we can specify in the
`type` variable whether the swap is a receiver or a payer one.


Let's look atthe code now. The function that gets modified the most is the 
`SwapCashflowYFCalculation` which I have re-named as `CashFlowPricing` one 
which now looks as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
CashFlowPricing  <- function(today, start.date, maturity.date, type,
                                     time.unit, dcc, calendar) {
  # Part 1: Calculate the whole cashflow dates
  cashflows <- seq(from = 0,
                   to = (lubridate::year(maturity.date) -
                           lubridate::year(start.date)) * 12,
                   by = time.unit) %>%
    purrr::map_dbl(~RQuantLib::advance(calendar = calendar,
                                       dates = start.date,
                                       n = .x,
                                       timeUnit = 2,
                                       bdc = 1,
                                       emr = TRUE)) %>%
    lubridate::as_date() %>%
    {if (start.date < today) append(today, .) else .}

  # Part 2: calculate accrual and rate fixing days
  accrual.date <- cashflows[today - cashflows > 0]

  if (!identical(as.double(accrual.date), double(0))) {
    accrual.date  %<>%  max()
    if (stringr::str_detect(type, "floating")) {
      fixing.date <- accrual.date %>%
        {RQuantLib::advance(calendar = calendar,
                            dates = .,
                            n = -2,
                            timeUnit = 0,
                            bdc = 1,
                            emr = TRUE)}
    } else {
      fixing.date <- NULL
    }
    accrual.yf <- accrual.date %>%
      {RQuantLib::yearFraction(today, ., dcc)} %>%
      `*`(-1)
  } else {
    fixing.date <- NULL
    accrual.yf <- 0
  }

  # Part 3: Tidy and return the list of relevant dates
  cashflows %<>%
    purrr::map_dbl(~RQuantLib::yearFraction(today, .x, dcc)) %>%
    tibble::tibble(yf = .) %>%
    dplyr::filter(yf >= 0)

  return(list(cashflows = cashflows, accrual.yf = accrual.yf,
              fixing.date = fixing.date))
}
```

Let's analyise the code:

* Part 1 is actually the core of the code previously described 

* Part 2 is the new code. `accrual.date` is the date from which the accrual starts
to be calculated. This gets converted into a year fraction and saved into `accrual.yf`.
The if statement calculates the date at which the floating EURIBOR rate has to
be snapped from Quandl only for the floating rate. This date is stored in the 
`fixing.date` variable and it considers a 2 days lag which is standard for the 
European market.

* Part 3 finally converts and returns all the future cashflows in terms of 
year fraction

You can note that we now calculate the cashflows for the floating leg even if
it will note be used by the `OLDParSwapRate` function. This will be needed for 
future developments when we will introduce the OIS discounting...(stay tuned!!)

I can now calculate the accrual and for this purpose I developed a brand new function
called `CalculateAccrual`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
CalculateAccrual <- function(swap.dates, leg.type, swap, direction) {
  # Part 1: calculate the accrual rate
  if (!is.null(swap.dates$fixing.date)) {
    rate <- Quandl::Quandl("BOF/QS_D_IEUTIO6M",
                           start_date = swap.dates$fixing.date,
                           end_date = swap.dates$fixing.date) %>%
      tibble::as_tibble(.) %>%
      dplyr::select(Value) %>%
      as.double %>%
      `/`(100)
  } else {
    rate <- swap$strike
  }
  # Part 2: Calculate the value of the accrual
  swap.dates %>%
    purrr::pluck("accrual.yf") %>%
    `*`(swap$notional * rate * switch(leg.type, "pay" = -1, "receive" = 1))
}
```

This is smaller and easier function:

* Part 1: for floating legs we use Quandl to download the needed data and extract
the rate information. For the fixed one, we just use the strike of the swap.

* Part 2: we calculate the actual accrual amount using the classical function

Let's see the final result on the 25 years' swap we use as test:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SwapPortfolioPricing(SwapPricer::swap.basket, lubridate::ymd(20190414), SwapPricer::df.table) %>% 
  dplyr::slice(1)
```

Let's compare the result with the Bloomberg screenshot

![](/post/2019-07-08-downloading-variable-rate_files/Pricing 25yrs floating.png)
You can see that we now perfectly price also the receiving accrual and, of course, 
also the total one.

We finish today's post by looking at the pricing of the basket. You can see that
now the algorithm correctly identifies what are the floating and the fixed legs
depending on the type of the swap (ie receiver or payer).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SwapPortfolioPricing(SwapPricer::swap.basket, lubridate::ymd(20190414), SwapPricer::df.table) %>% 
  dplyr::slice(-nrow(.)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_at(dplyr::vars("clean.mv","dirty.mv","accrual.pay",
                               "accrual.receive","pv01"),formattable::comma) %>%
  dplyr::mutate_at(dplyr::vars("par"), formattable::percent) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Pricing results", "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed","responsive"))
```
