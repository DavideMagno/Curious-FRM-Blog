<p>All the investment banks in the world must submit the information about their trades to a trade repository called DTCC. We report the anonymysed version of such data as published by DTCC here (<a href="https://pddata.dtcc.com/gtr/cftc/dashboard.do" class="uri">https://pddata.dtcc.com/gtr/cftc/dashboard.do</a>) in a dashboard that tracks the evolution through time of the global investments in a specific trade called “interest rate swaps”.</p>
<p>We report the global amounts traded by currency, split the type of swap (OIS or Libor)for each day since the beginning of 2021. We also provide snapshots of the full data used at any date, which can be selected by the dashboard user.</p>
