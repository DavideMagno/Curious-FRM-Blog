In the previous posts we have seen how easy it is to price interest rate swaps
using R. I am honoured to announce that I have decided to put all the functions
I have described together into a package that is called...SwapPricer! 

Ok, the name is not super original, but it should at least be easy to remember.

You can install it as follows:

```{r}
# library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("DavideMagno/SwapPricer")
```

The package is still unfortunately not on CRAN but it has an official hexagon. 
Here it is:

style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" height="223.5" 
width="192.75"/>

Let me know if you like it in the Disqus form below in the post.

In order to price a swap you just need to run the following code.

```{r example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(SwapPricer)
SwapPortfolioPricing(SwapPricer::swap.basket, lubridate::ymd(20190414), SwapPricer::df.table)
```

You can see that I have used two objects that are delivered with the package:

* *swap.basket* which consists in a 5 swaps portfolio that can be referenced as
blueprint for your swap portfolio

* *df.table* this is the discount curve downloaded from Bloomberg as at the 14th
of April 2019

We have tested the package using a 500 swaps portfolio and the results, in terms
of performance are very encouraging. We analyse them using the amazing *profvis*
tool.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
profvis::profvis({SwapPortfolioPricing(SwapPricer:::realworld.portfolio, lubridate::ymd(20190414), df.table)})
```

The results are quite interesting as they show we can split the code in three parts:

  1) The first one converts the inputs in tabular form into list of lists of the 
same format as we described in this post.

  2) The second one is the one that takes the biggest amount of time and it 
corresponds to the `CashFlowPricing` function. We have described this function 
in detail in this post. If we dig into the profvis output, we can notice that
the function that takes the most time is the `RQuantlib::advance` one. Unfortunately,
this great function doesn't have a vectorised version hence we need to use functional
programming like `map` to calculate multiple future cashflows. Also the `RQuantlib::yearFraction`
function doesn't have a vectorised version hence I have preferred using another
function that does the same but in a vectorised way. This function is `fmdates::year_frac`.
The difference in performance is sizeable, as you can see from the *microbenchmark*
test below:

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
test <- seq(from = 3, to = 50*12, by = 3)
cashflows <- today + months(test)

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  "Rquantlib" = mapply(function(x) RQuantLib::yearFraction(today, x, 2), cashflows),
  "fmdates" = fmdates::year_frac(today, cashflows, "act/365")
)
```
  
  The difference in pricing is quite striking. I have submitted an [issue](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rquantlib/issues/135) request on the Github
page of RQuantLib, let's hope they'll want to implement a vectorised version of their
cashflow functions.


  3) The actual pricing of the 500 swaps takes less than 1 second. This is very 
encouraging because when it will come to curve optimisation (formerly known as
**bootstrapping**) or risk sensitivities and scenarios, parts 1 and 2 will be run
once at the beginning of the process while part 3 will be run multiple times.

Finally, I want to warn you: the package is still in a very early version, 
this is just v0.1.0, hence it is able to price just:

1) EUR swaps that pay semi-annually on the floating leg

2) Using a one-curve framework

**We are working to improve the toolbox in the next releases**

This is the plan of improvements (after I'll submit the current version on CRAN
for everybody to more easily access it - I am thinking, for example, 
to corporate networks that have the ports to Github blocked):

1) Extend to all the other currencies, custom frequencies and conventions

2) Introduce OIS discounting

3) Calculate additional risk measures like DV01, bucketed DV01 and Convexity

It's going to be an interesting and long ride, you are welcome on-board!
